Achieved up to 35x speedup compared to the CPU implementation. \r\n\r\n#### + [HTTP/HTTPS MITM Proxy](https://github.com/tylerwowen/mitm_proxy)\r\nAn HTTP/HTTPS proxy that also supports man in the middle attacks. \r\n\r\n#### + [FTP Swarming Download Client](https://github.com/tylerwowen/FTP_Client)\r\nAn FTP swarming download client implemented in C at socket level.\r\n\r\n#### + WeCode\r\nWeb-based collaboration app for online office hours.\r\nI designed front-end and back-end architecture, and implemented real-time code editing, file system, and share terminal.\r\nWon [the First Place](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/spotlights/capstone-award-winners-victors-go-spoils) in the Capstone competition.\r\n\r\n#### + [GOLDDigger](http://tylerwowen.github.io/golddigger/)\r\nThird-party GOLD client application for UCSB students. \r\n\r\n#### + [QRBuddy](http://tylerwowen.github.io/wechatbuddy/)\r\nShow your QR code on your pebble.  \r\nQRBuddy includes two parts: Pebble WatchApp and its companion mobile apps (iOS and Android). The WatchApp can show the QR code transferred from companion mobile apps. Thus users can show their QR code on their wrist fast and easily.  \r\n\r\n#### + [PiSensors](https://github.com/tylerwowen/pisensors)\r\nNode.js + Express.js + Raspberry Pi = Sensors Web Portal\r\n\r\n- Displays real-time sensor data from Raspberry Pi. Implemented with Node.js, Express.js, and Python.  \r\n- Live video stream with control over camera direction.\r\n\r\n#### + [QR Helper](http://tylerwowen.github.io/qr_helper/)\r\nA Safari browser extension that decodes QR code in web pages.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/weimin-tyler-ouyang/89/999/4b8\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/img/webpromo/btn_viewmy_160x33.png\" width=\"160\" height=\"33\" border=\"0\" alt=\"View Weimin  (Tyler) Ouyang's profile on LinkedIn\">\r\n</a>  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Resume\r\nMy newest resume is always available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8WWHHPFdW35WHdHRnJJYURyMlE/view?usp=sharing)\r\n",
